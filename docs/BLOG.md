# Building a Kubernetes MCP Server: Architecture, Implementation, and Usage

## Introduction
In today's cloud-native world, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters can be challenging. To address this, I built the `k8s-mcp-server`, a Python-based control plane that simplifies multi-cluster management by providing a unified API to interact with Kubernetes resources. This blog post covers the architecture, technical details, usage, and code examples for this project.

## What is MCP?
**MCP** stands for **Management Control Plane**. It acts as a central server that interacts with one or more Kubernetes clusters, exposing APIs for clients (CLI tools, dashboards, or other services) to manage deployments, pods, services, and more.

- **MCP Server:** The backend service that talks to Kubernetes clusters.
- **MCP Client:** Any tool or script that sends requests to the MCP Server to perform operations.

## Architecture Overview

    A["MCP Client"] -->|API Request| B["MCP Server"]
    B -->|Kubernetes API| C["Kubernetes Cluster 1"]
    B -->|Kubernetes API| D["Kubernetes Cluster 2"]
```

- **MCP Client:** Sends REST/gRPC requests to the MCP Server.
- **MCP Server:** Handles requests, authenticates, and interacts with Kubernetes clusters.
- **Kubernetes Clusters:** The actual clusters being managed.

---

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Key Libraries:** `kubernetes` Python client, (optionally FastAPI/Flask for API exposure)
- **Modules:**
  - `k8s_client.py`: Handles Kubernetes API interactions.
  - `k8s_deployments.py`, `k8s_pods.py`, `k8s_services.py`, etc.: Resource-specific logic.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the server.
  - `k8s_utils.py`: Utility functions for Kubernetes operations.

### Example: Listing Pods
```python
from src.k8s_pods import list_pods

pods = list_pods(namespace="default")
for pod in pods:
    print(pod.metadata.name)
```

## How to Use the MCP Server

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Access to Kubernetes clusters (kubeconfig)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k8s-mcp-server.git
cd k8s-mcp-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Server
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Example API Call
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/pods?namespace=default
```

## Code Snippets & Examples

### Deploying a Service
```python
from src.k8s_services import create_service

service_manifest = {...}  # Define your Kubernetes service manifest here
create_service(namespace="default", manifest=service_manifest)
```

### Listing Deployments
```python
from src.k8s_deployments import list_deployments

deployments = list_deployments(namespace="default")
for dep in deployments:
    print(dep.metadata.name)
```

### Listing ReplicaSets
```python
from src.k8s_replicasets import list_replicasets

replicasets = list_replicasets(namespace="default")
for rs in replicasets:
    print(rs.metadata.name)
```

### Utility Example: Loading Kubeconfig
```python
from src.k8s_utils import load_kube_config

load_kube_config()  # Loads kubeconfig for cluster access
```

---

## Advanced Usage
- **Multi-Cluster Management:** Configure the MCP server to connect to multiple clusters by updating your kubeconfig or extending the client logic.
- **Extending Resources:** Add new modules for additional Kubernetes resources as needed.
- **Containerization:** Use the provided Dockerfile to build and run the MCP server as a container.

### Docker Example
```bash
docker build -t k8s-mcp-server .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube k8s-mcp-server
```
